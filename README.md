Ask Amazon's Alexa about what the public thinks about a topic. Use the voice interface to ask questions such as "Hey Alexa, what does the public think of 'Donald Trump' at the moment?" 

## Idea 
The idea is to allow anyone to analyze the percentage of positive, negative and neutral tweets on a certain topic over a voice interface. 

## Concepts and Tools 
Written in Python 3 using Flask and Flask-ask. Consume Twitter API to retrive twitter data.

## Future Goals
Use better probabalistic models to run various hypothesis tests over custom user queries.
